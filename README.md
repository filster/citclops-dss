Background information
----------------------

This development has been originally carried out in the context of the Citclops European project by Eurecat. One of the main objectives in Citclops was to deliver interpreted information to citizens, decision makers and researchers. This information is provided through tools capable of retrieving, visualising, analysing and interpreting marine data of interest. These tools have personalised interfaces depending on the user’s requirements. In order to do that, machine-learning techniques are used to interpret collected data of water colour, transparency and fluorescence, and other context variables. The purpose of this repository is to share the development and implementation of the Citclops Data Explorer decision support system (DSS). More information is available at [http://www.citclops.eu/], [http://citclops-data-explorer.herokuapp.com/], [http://www.eyeonwater.org/] and in the file "Integration and implementation of the Citclops Data Explorer.pdf".
